This is a simple checklist website where multiple lists can be created to keep track of tasks and activities for any particular occasion.

It uses Node.js and Express.js for Back-end and HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap for Front-end. It also uses mongoDB to store and access data in real time.

=> New lists can be created by just adding the name of the new list e.g. "Work" at the end of the root url i.e, "https://checklist-app.com/Work". 

=> No need to wory about case sensitivity the website has got that covered.                                

=> New items can be added using the add item section at the bottom of each list.

=> Items can be simply deleted by just clicking on the checkbox besides the item.
